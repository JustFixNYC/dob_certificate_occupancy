# DOB Certificate of Occupancy data

DOB makes available a dataset of certificate of occupancy records on Open Data, but, as of September 2024, it only covers 2012-07-12 to the present. The new Good Cause Eviction law has an exemption for properties that received a certificate of occupancy on or after 2009-01-01 so to this requires additional historic data. 

## FOIL request
